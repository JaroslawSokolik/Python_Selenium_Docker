Example of easy docker integration with selenium tests :)

Usage:

1.git pull https://github.com/JaroslawSokolik/Python_Selenium_Docker.git
2.Run "docker-compose up"

That's it

Selenium script goes to python.org, makes a screenshot.Then goes to Pypi and search for "selenium" and make another screenshot.

Both screenshots are saved in screenshot file.

Enjoy :)

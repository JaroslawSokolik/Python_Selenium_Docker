Example of easy docker integration with selenium tests :)

Usage:

1.git pull https://github.com/JaroslawSokolik/Python_Selenium_Docker.git
2.Run "docker-compose up"

That's it

Selenium script goes to python.org, makes a screenshot.Then goes to Pypi and search for "selenium".

Then screenshot is made again and saved inn the project.

Enjoy :)

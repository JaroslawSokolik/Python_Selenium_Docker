## **Example of easy docker integration with selenium tests :)**

Usage:

1.git pull https://github.com/JaroslawSokolik/Python_Selenium_Docker.git

2.Run "docker-compose up"

That's it!!!

Docker will build everything that's needed to run the test.

Test Scenario:

- Script will go to python.org and save a screenshot.

- Script will go to Pypi, search for "selenium" and and save a screenshot.

Both screenshots will be saved in screenshot file.

Enjoy :)
